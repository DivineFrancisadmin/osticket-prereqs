<p> Azure Virtual Machine Setup for osTicket Installation

To set up my Azure Virtual Machine for osTicket, I started by creating a Windows 10 VM in the Azure Portal with 2 vCPUs. I named it osticket-vm and set my credentials as Username: labuser and Password: osTicketPassword1!. After the VM was deployed, I enabled Remote Desktop (RDP) by going to the Networking section in Azure and allowing RDP (Port 3389) under inbound rules. Then, on my local PC, I opened the Windows Remote Desktop app from the App Store, entered my VMâ€™s public IP address, and logged in using my credentials. This gave me remote access to manage my virtual machine.

</p>
<p>
After successfully connecting to my Azure Virtual Machine via Remote Desktop, I proceeded to enable IIS with CGI to prepare for the osTicket installation. I started by opening the Control Panel, then navigated to Programs and Features and selected Turn Windows features on or off. From there, I expanded Internet Information Services (IIS) and then World Wide Web Services. Under Application Development Features, I checked the box for CGI to enable it. Once selected, I clicked OK and waited for Windows to apply the changes. This step ensured that IIS was properly configured with CGI support for the upcoming osTicket setup.</p>
